After a brief stint as a theatre major at the University of Southern California, I returned home to Ohio to complete a B.A. in Communications from The Ohio State University and later a Master of Education in Literacy. Teacher by day, writer by night, I am pursuing my dream career as an author of suspense. Inner struggle and family dynamics are inherently interwoven in my work. I am a member of Romance Writers of America (Central Ohio Fiction Writers, Kiss of Death, and Celtic Hearts chapters), International Thriller Writers, Sisters in Crime (SiC Columbus Ohio chapter), and Mystery Writers of America, as well as other local cooperatives. I live in Jeffersonville, Ohio with my husband, Doug, and daughter, Jillian. In my free time I can be found at the local movie theatre, curled up on the sofa with a good book, or in the barn taking care of the family's two horses, nine chickens, six cats, two dogs, and three rabbits (not to mention a hedgehog). I am currently at work on my second novel as I pursue publication. Accomplishments: Third place in the 2014 Golden Claddagh Contest",

Growing up, she was a voracious reader of anything she could get her hands on, including her friend Cindi's Nancy Drew books, her father's Greek mythology books, sports books, Agatha Christie books from her weekly library trips, and by the age of eight had read the KJV Bible cover-to-cover.  As she got older, she gravitated more toward mystery fiction. Any book at the public library that had a skull and crossbones symbol on its spine inevitably found its way home with Bree. And then she discovered Stephen King. It was love. Or maybe it was just indigestion. Fully intending to write Mystery, perhaps even Horror, Bree was steered toward Romance Writers of America by a high-school friend, and Bree fell in love with Contemporary Romance. Stephen King was kicked to the curb (sorry Stephen!). Bree is a member of Romance Writers of America and Central Ohio Fiction Writers, and is currently living her own Happily Ever After in Ohio with her husband, their two toddlers, and a Black Labrador, Jasmine.",

      "blurb": "Born and raised in Utah, Sandy Loyd, a Western girl through and through, now resides in Louisville, Kentucky. As much as she loves her current hometown, she misses the mountains and has to go back to her roots to get her mountain and skiing fix at least once a year. Otherwise her muse suffers. As a former sales rep for a major manufacturer, she's traveled extensively, so she has a million stored memories to draw from for her stories. She spent her single years in San Francisco and considers that city one of America's treasures, comparable to no other city in the world. Her California Series, starting out with Winter Interlude, are all set in the Bay Area. Sandy is now an empty nester and writes full time. With almost two dozen books published in several genres including contemporary romance, romantic suspense, time travel romance and historical romance, she strives to come up with fun characters—people you would love to call friends. And we all know friends have their baggage and when we discover what makes them tick, we come to love them even more. She doesn't skimp on the romance. And because she loves puzzles, she doesn't skimp on intrigue, either. Yet whether romantic suspense, contemporary romance, or historical romance, she always tries to weave a warm love story into her work, while providing enough twists and turns to entertain any reader.",

      "blurb": "A native of Muncie, Indiana, Sandy has lived in north-central Ohio since 1973.  She's been an LPN since 1980. She has her husband of 34 years, two sons, a daughter-in-law, two granddaughters, two dogs, and an odd number of goldfish in her outdoor pond all living with her in an 1890s home that was a general store\\post office. Fortunately, only her dog has commandeered her writer's cave so far. Sandy began writing in third grade when she turned her dreams and nightmares into short stories (she still has that notebook). Science fiction classics and comic books were her reading mainstay; as an adult, she added historical fiction then romances in the '80s. The adult writing bug bit in 1990 after a comment by her oldest son. When she realized she needed cheap nursing CEUs and the degree most writers seem to have, Ohio State University beckoned. While earning an English degree, she wrote for three newspapers and was a feature writer for Choice, a Christian magazine. Now she writes romance, science fiction, inspirational, women's fiction, and a mix of them all, and substitutes in local schools, teaches college English 101 in local prisons, gardens, and does many types of artwork.",

Adventures ensue, hilarity happens, but the hero always ends up with his lady. And vice versa. Ms. Heino began her writing career in the theatre. She worked for several years in various small theatre and repertory groups where she did everything from writing, casting, and directing to acting, singing, and mopping floors. Somehow along the way she ended up married to a Lutheran pastor and turned her love of history, humor and happy endings toward writing romance. In 2008 she won RWA's Golden Heart Award for Best Regency Historical and signed her first multi-book deal after going to auction. She has gone on to hit best-sellers lists and branch out into other Romance sub-genres, but her first love will always be the Regency time period. She is a member of RWA's Beaumonde Regency specialty chapter as well as a member of the Jane Austen Society of North America. Ms. Heino is an author, workshop presenter, and preacher's wife who lives in rural Ohio with her non-cravat-inclined husband, two very remarkable children, and an accidental collection of critters.
