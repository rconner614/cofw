She has longed to write her own novels since she was a wee girl reading every Judy Blume book she could get her hands on. So a few years ago, she left her thriving corporate career to satisfy the voices in her head. Now as a full-time author and stay-at-home mom, she spends her days tucked into her cozy office, Havanese puppy by her side, working to translate her effusive imagination into the written word. Lorie’s first solo novel, Gilt Hollow, a YA romantic thriller, was released in September 2016.</p>"

But if you nail down the characters' motivation, it doesn't matter whether the ship capsizes or lands safely three hours later. Your characters will create a plot from WHATEVER happens because you've got their motivation built in from the very beginning...and here's how to do it. From Plot to Finish: Once a writer knows the elements that belong in her characters and her plot, she's all set...right? Well, not always. Making the move from a few basic answers to a manuscript which is ready to type involves a series of steps that people have called \"incredible...a plotting system which truly RESPECTS that I'm a pantser\" and \"the easiest way I've ever seen of getting from Basic Idea to Finished Book.\"</p><p><strong>Afternoon Session:</strong><br>Building Conflict from the Head Down: They're perfect for each other, right? So why can't things ever seem to go as smoothly for these people as they deserve? Well, you know why--it's because nobody wants the happy ending to arrive five minutes into the book. Which means we need to stir up conflict for these characters, and no matter what kind of conflict is happening around them it'll be even more dramatic when you get the conflict happening inside each one.</p><p>Laurie Schnebly also writes and produces videos, brochures and commercials for a Phoenix advertising agency. She'd written six books for Special Edition before turning to non-fiction, using her research into the nine personality types to help writers create plausible, likable people with realistic flaws.
