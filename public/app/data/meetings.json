Motif and metaphor are ways to deepen your storyâ€™s meaning without putting that meaning blatantly on the page. Through careful analysis of your completed first draft, you can find the things that you unconsciously put into your story and enhance them to create the kind of emotional subtext that draws a reader in without hitting her over the head with MEANING.</p>"
