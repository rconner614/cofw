She has longed to write her own novels since she was a wee girl reading every Judy Blume book she could get her hands on. So a few years ago, she left her thriving corporate career to satisfy the voices in her head. Now as a full-time author and stay-at-home mom, she spends her days tucked into her cozy office, Havanese puppy by her side, working to translate her effusive imagination into the written word.

It's because nobody wants the happy ending to arrive five minutes into the book, which means we need to stir up conflict for these characters. No matter what kind of conflict is happening around them, it'll be even more dramatic when you get the conflict happening  ​inside.</p><p>PLOTTING VIA MOTIVATION: Any one of us could write a book in which characters set out for a three-hour tour and get shipwrecked on an uncharted desert isle. But if you nail down the characters' motivation, it doesn't matter whether the ship capsizes or lands safely three hours later. Your characters will create a plot from WHATEVER happens because you've got their motivation built in from the very beginning...and here's how to do it.</p><p><strong>Afternoon Session:</strong><br>​FROM PLOT TO FINISH: Once a writer knows the elements that belong in her characters and her plot, she's all ​set...right? Well, not always. Making the move from a few basic answers to a manuscript which is ready to type involves a series of steps that people have called \"incredible...a plotting system which truly RESPECTS that I'm a pantser\" and \"the easiest way I've ever seen of getting from Basic Idea to Finished Book.\"​</p><p>ALPHA MALES, FROM ABE TO ZEUS: Readers love alpha males. (Maybe not for real-life marriage, but for romantic adventure there’s nothing better.) Yet writers ​often find it tricky to create one without falling into stereotypes. What makes an alpha male? (It’s more than just power.) What challenges does he face? (The answers will surprise you.) How can your hero take on solely the alpha traits you want? Get ready to find out​...and maybe to fall in love.</p><p>Laurie Schnebly also writes and produces videos, brochures and commercials for a Phoenix advertising agency. She'd written six books for Special Edition before turning to non-fiction, using her research into the nine personality types to help writers create plausible, likable people with realistic flaws.

Leigh Bailey</strong></p><p>The very first encounter between the romantic leads of your story sets the tone for the rest of the book. This encounter either pulls the reader deeper into the story or makes them decide the book isn't for them. The meet-cute--the quirky, funny, sexy, and/or memorable way two people meet for the first time--has been used for decades in film, television, and novels as a way to get the audience immediately sucked into the romantic storyline. This program will use examples from popular movies, television shows, and books to identify the main characteristics of an effective meet-cute, to recognize the basic formulas and tropes of the meet-cute, and to explore ways to create fresh versions of this classic plot device.</p><p>J. Leigh Bailey is an office drone by day and the author of Young Adult LGBT Romance by night. She can usually be found with her nose in a book or pressed up against her computer monitor. A book-a-day reading habit sometimes gets in the way of... well, everything...but some habits aren't worth breaking. She's been reading romance novels since she was ten years old. The last twenty years or so have not changed her voracious appetite for stories of romance, relationships and achieving that vitally important Happy Ever After. She's a firm believer that everyone, no matter their gender, age, sexual orientation or paranormal affiliation deserves a happy ending.</p>"
