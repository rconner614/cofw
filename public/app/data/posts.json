Leigh Bailey</strong></p><p>The very first encounter between the romantic leads of your story sets the tone for the rest of the book. This encounter either pulls the reader deeper into the story or makes them decide the book isn't for them. The meet-cute--the quirky, funny, sexy, and/or memorable way two people meet for the first time--has been used for decades in film, television, and novels as a way to get the audience immediately sucked into the romantic storyline. This program will use examples from popular movies, television shows, and books to identify the main characteristics of an effective meet-cute, to recognize the basic formulas and tropes of the meet-cute, and to explore ways to create fresh versions of this classic plot device.</p><p>J. Leigh Bailey is an office drone by day and the author of Young Adult LGBT Romance by night. She can usually be found with her nose in a book or pressed up against her computer monitor. A book-a-day reading habit sometimes gets in the way of... well, everything...but some habits aren't worth breaking. She's been reading romance novels since she was ten years old. The last twenty years or so have not changed her voracious appetite for stories of romance, relationships and achieving that vitally important Happy Ever After. She's a firm believer that everyone, no matter their gender, age, sexual orientation or paranormal affiliation deserves a happy ending.</p>"

Through careful analysis of your completed first draft, you can find the things that you unconsciously put into your story and enhance them to create the kind of emotional subtext that draws a reader in without hitting her over the head with MEANING. The repetition of those motifs and metaphors can also give your story unity, making the reader feel as if she’s in safe hands, that there’s an authority in complete control of the narrative. Although motif and metaphor seem as though they belong in a English class, they’re actually valuable, practical tools for writing a compelling and unified story.</p><p>Jenny Crusie is a NYT bestseller and two-time RWA Rita winner. She has written more than twenty novels, which have been published in 20 countries. She has a Master’s degree from Wright State University in Professional Writing and Women’s Literature and an MFA from the Ohio State University. She has taught at Antioch University, Wright State University, Ohio State and McDaniel College, where she helped design the curriculum for the graduate level Romance Writing program.</p><p>Our meeting will be held via Zoom.
