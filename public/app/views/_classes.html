                                Chaffee Scardamalia</h4>
                            <p>August 1-31 2021 Online Course</p>
                            <p>The basis of modern storytelling whether in print or on the screen, lies deeply rooted in
                                the mythological tradition. And that mythological tradition, whether myth or fairy tale,
                                is shaped and created by visions and dreams, according to mythologist, Joseph Campbell.
                            </p>
                            <p>Game of Thrones, Clash of the Titans, Thor, Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, Snow White and
                                the Huntsman, Once Upon a Time, Grimm—all popular books, movies and TV series that have
                                their roots in the realms of myth and fairy tale.</p>
                            <p>For writers, the realm of myth, fairy tale and dreams is one of unending storytelling
                                possibilities. This workshop defines and describes the elements and characteristics, as
                                well as the differences of myth and fairy tales and how you can use them for stories
                                that capture your reader. And it will show you how to tap into the mythic power of
                                dreams for personal yet universal stories.</p>

                                with Laurie Sue Brockway</h4>
                            <p>October 4-31 2021 Online Course</p>
                            <p>Romance readers love weddings. It began with Jane Austin and continues with Hallmark and
                                in every genre in between. How can we, as writers, make weddings unforgettable and
                                romantic? We can make them real and filled with details that make them come alive.</p>
                            <p>We've all been to weddings, and many of us have written weddings in our romance stories
                                and novels, but have you ever wanted to expand your writing of the wedding scene to
                                include more nuances and insights into the ceremony itself? And do you seek a more
                                reality-based looks at wedding stress―and drama―that can make the story more exciting?
                            </p>
                            <p>As readers seek more diverse character, it is helpful to be able to write about real
                                weddings that reflect the spiritual and cultural values of the couple and their
                                families. In this course we will look at how to design contemporary fictional ceremonies
                                for characters of all backgrounds, cultures, and faiths; and, how to research weddings
                                of all kinds to fit your story.</p>
                            <p><strong>This course will include:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Basic outline of a contemporary wedding ceremony and ideas for prayers, readings,
                                    and sharing the couple’s love story as part of the wedding.</li>
                                <li>A run-down of the kinds of ceremonies your couples may have ― religious,
                                    non-religious contemporary, non-denominational, alternative, civil, new age, or
                                    highly cultural – and the cast of characters that may be involved (and can help you
                                    move your story along!).</li>
                                <li>Details, nuances, and rituals for a host of different cultures, such as what happens
                                    at a Hindu wedding, a Celtic ceremony, or a same sex ceremony. </li>
                                <li>Writing wedding vows and creating scenes in which you can have your couples speak
                                    these words from the heart.</li>
                                <li>Insights into real family issues, dynamics, and conflict situations that can arise
                                    to make your fictional wedding more fascinating (there are a lot!).</li>
                                <li>Inspiration for the experience of the couple at the altar ― how they look at each
                                    other, what they say with their eyes, their words, and their body language.</li>
                                <li>Different kinds of venues in which to set a wedding ― from beaches and parks, to
                                    castles and mansions, home weddings to big hotels, and houses of worship to romantic
                                    destinations. </li>
                                <li>Ideas for engagement stories and proposals.</li>
                            </ul>

                                your couples to the altar. Each week will offer tips on different aspects of the wedding
                                planning and ceremony and will also give you assignments for crafting your own wedding
                                readings, vows, and love stories to tell as part of the wedding. We will have some fun
                                research as well!
