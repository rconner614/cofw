What if two men awakened in each others' bodies after a terrible auto accident? What if they both loved the same woman and one was married to her? That's just one plot among her many pre-published novels and novellas. Look on Amazon. “Shot through the Heart,” is a traditional Regency available on Kindle. Beautiful women and dashing heroes negotiate the pitfalls of the Season. Is the duel in Hyde Park just an excuse for murder? Meddling aunts and annoying animals are not totally helpful in solving the mystery. Watch for more postings on Amazon in the near future."

      "blurb": "Shari Heinrich is a nationally award-winning author. She writes young adult fantasy where magic drives her characters. Filled with sass and heart, those teens won’t back down when it comes to protecting their friends, their family, or their dreams.<br><br>When Shari’s not out writing in her backyard, you’ll find her there tending her vegetable garden, and looking for ways to deter the deer from eating the crops. Maybe she’s riding her bike, enjoying the central Ohio countryside. When she sits still, it’s to lose herself in a book. Or she’s playing “fetch” with her cats after they’ve skewered her big toe to say it’s time to throw the toy across the room. Again.<br><br>The photography bug bit her about the same time as the writing bug. She can’t resist bringing her camera when she’s writing outside. She swears she doesn’t use the camera for procrastination when the characters shyly resist telling their stories."

      "blurb": "Ever since she can remember, Kimberly Beckett has loved horses. She wore out 4 rocking horses before she was 5 years old, and as she got older, she read every horse story in print, from Black Beauty to My Friend Flicka. It wasn't until she got her first job as an attorney for the federal government, however, that could afford to buy her first horse, and she hasn't been without at least one ever since. She has been riding dressage for several years and has earned her United States Dressage Federation Bronze Medal. When she wasn't reading about horses, she was reading romance novels, and her favorites always involve an alpha male Hero riding a magnificent horse. Kimberly has now found a way to combine her love of horses with her love of romance by writing her own version of equine-facilitated happily ever afters. She truly believes that Horses Heal Hearts. She lives in southwest Ohio."
